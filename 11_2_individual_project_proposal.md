# Individual project proposal

**Due:** Sunday 7 Apr 11:59 PM

Submit a page or less description of your proposed project. The scope of the project is something you can do in about 4 weeks. You can choose between a coding project or a literature review. The project will culminate in a 15 min presentation in finals week and submitted code or literature review.



## Coding project

1. A brief statement of the prediction problem. What is the general prediction goal?
2. Describe the response variable (i.e. the variable you want to *predict*) in some detail. How were the data collected? What is the size of the dataset? Comment on data quality, etc.
3. Describe the *predictor* variables and any planned feature engineering (data transformation etc).
4. Describe the machine learning algorithms(s) you intend to use (e.g. algorithms to compare such as random forests vs xgboost, ideas for the architecture of NN, etc).
5. How do you plan to train, tune, and evaluate the model? (e.g. How will you divide the data into training, validation, and/or test sets? What parameters will you tune? What loss or error function will you use to measure predictive performance?).



## Literature review (alternative)
The review will be 3000-5000 words (or 5-10 pages with figures), not including references.

1. A tentative title for the review.
2. A brief description of the research questions you want to apply machine learning to (i.e. the questions in ecology, evolution, environment etc).
3. A tentative outline. In addition to reviewing machine learning algorithms applied to the research questions in (2), the review should consider the specific types of response and predictor variables, feature engineering, and details about training, tuning, and evaluating models (see 2-5 in coding project above).
