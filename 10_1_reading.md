#### Discussion papers for week 10

You need to read the paper plus submit a small written reflection. The reflection should be **pushed to github before class**.  You won't get credit for the discussion unless you push to github before class. The reflection should include your thoughts on each of the questions under "questions to consider" below. It can be very brief and in bullet-point form but feel free to expand if you prefer.



**Tuesday**

* Valavi R, Guillera-Arroita G, Lahoz-Monfort JJ, Elith J (2021). Predictive performance of presence-only species distribution models: a benchmark study with reproducible code. *Ecological Monographs* 0:e01486. https://doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1486.
* This is a case study using a range of machine learning algorithms, including random forest and boosting (but not deep learning)
* Questions to consider:
  * What general principles of machine learning algorithms are demonstrated among the models considered?
  * What modeling approaches were found to be best?
  * What is it about those algorithms that likely made them the best performers?
  * Can the performance of any of the algorithms be improved (and likely by how much)?
  * Why does downsampled random forest perform better than regular random forest? Would this effect other algorithms?
  * What could be the impact of sample size on the conclusions from this paper?
  * Do you have any critiques of the paper, either methodological or about the conclusions drawn?
  * 2-3 other bullet points, which might be insights or questions you want to raise in the discussion



**Thursday**

* Student meetings about individual projects
* Zoom
